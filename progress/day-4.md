### About Task

There is an assignment given in the form of creating a new repository on github and filling in the markdown file to apply the use of git. The markdown file must contain learning progress for 4 days. I tried to apply it by creating 4 branches namely **chore/day-1**, **chore/day-2**, **chore/day-3**, and **chore/day-4**. then each branch only has one file, namely progress.md.
