# Day 2

Day 2 contains website material, UI/UX Design, and figma.

## 1. The Different between Website and Web App

**Website** is a collection of web pages and related content that is usually published on the Internet and can be accessed on the browser. Website is commonly built for these categories:

- [Personal website](https://mhaidarhanif.com/)
- [Company website](https://about.meta.com/)
- [Organization website](https://webfoundation.org/)
- [School or university website](https://ugm.ac.id/en)
- [Government website](https://www.japan.go.jp/)
- [Community website](https://www.jakartajs.org/)

Based on these categories, website is often much simpler than web application. It has very limited interactivity, because what we can do is usually only reading or consuming the content.

Web application or just called a "web app" usually has more features and interaction with the users than a regular website.

As typical web app contains some contents that provided by the users, these contents are dynamic or change a lot, so a web app usually called "dynamic website". For example:

- [Information and encyclopedia](https://www.dictionary.com/)
- [News and magazine](https://www.bbc.com/news)
- [Writing and publication](https://medium.com/)

## 2. The difference between ui and ux.

What we visually see on the bag is similar to how we say the **"interface"**, or User Interface (UI) design. UI design consists of buttons, icons, layout, color, typography, and many more. Then what we can feel and how we use them are similar to how we say the **"experience"**, or User Experience (UX) design. **User interface (UI)** design is the process and result of planning and building interfaces in software that focus on appearance and styles. The purpose of UI design is to make the website or application easy to use and pleasing to the eyes. **User experience (UX)** design is the experience a person feels when interacting with the website. UX design's purpose is to provide great and relevant experiences to users. It involves aspects of branding, usability, and function.

### Different forms of interface

**The graphical user interface (GUI)** is a form of UI that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical layout and imagery, such as windows and buttons. It is the most common UI we see nowadays. **A command-line interface (CLI)** is a text-based UI used to view and manage computer files. **Voice-controlled interfaces (VUIs)** which users can interact with these through their voices.

## 3. How to make ui/ux design.

Design fidelity process:

![Design fidelity process](https://catamystlearn.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd1a32e87-9221-4e8c-a950-764d75f5e700%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=2c371eda-6c23-4b38-a2dc-743ad6e7dabd&spaceId=9a437d88-f112-4f91-b6e5-6588d2b298a4&width=860&userId=&cache=v2)

**Sketch** it’s basically just a raw freehand drawing on a piece of paper, that gives we a low-fidelity representation of your app. **Wireframe** is a low-fidelity way of showing a design. It’s the graphic representation of an app or a website containing the most essential elements and the content. A wireframe is like a blueprint of a building. **Mockup** is a visual way of representing a product. While a wireframe mostly represents a product’s structure, a mockup shows how the product is going to look like. But still, a mockup is not clickable (just like the wireframe). **Prototype** is often a high fidelity representation of the final product which is meant to simulate user interaction. Unlike the previous two, a prototype is clickable and thus allows the user to experience content and interactions in the interface.

## 6. Design Tools

[Figma: the collaborative interface design tool.](https://figma.com)

## About Task

There is an assignment to start the progress of the month 1 project, which is the creation of a personal website design using figma. In this task, I used [this website](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) to determine the color palette that is suitable for my website. I also tried to imitate the behavior on the personal website of [Prawito Hudoro](https://prawito.com) for me to follow the user experience pattern. I also tried to apply consistency in the design that I made where there are certain shapes and colors used for clickable components. The resulting output can be seen in this [reference](https://www.figma.com/design/CQ9EnK6lsBx3GyCpFEy8as/difasulthon.com?node-id=6-2&t=iLQ0SF3TC2NMO3fH-0).
